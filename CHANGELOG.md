# Changelog

## 2.0.0

Complete rework: the four per-tool binaries (hevcconverter, ac3converter,
cleaner, dupfinder) and the interim bash suite collapse into a single
`mediatool` binary with subcommands.

- `convert` — HEVC conversion with the runtime encoder probe
  (nvenc → qsv → vaapi → x265), movie/camera/lowq/chromecast modes, HDR
  preservation, Dolby Vision skip, safety gates and retry ladder
  (supersedes hevcconverter; adds VAAPI for Intel and AMD GPUs).
- `clean` — non-whitelisted-language track removal (cs/en default) as a
  pure remux with stream-count gates.
- `ac3` — AC3 640k compatibility-track appending; E-AC3 is deliberately
  never converted.
- `dup` — duplicate audio track report.
- `enhance` — Real-ESRGAN pipeline with aspect-preserving 1080p output and
  a natively downloaded engine.
- Shared: dot ignore files (union of shared + legacy per-tool names),
  `.old` backups with clobber protection, dry runs, interrupt-safe temp
  cleanup, runtime encoder probing, Go tests with fake ffmpeg/ffprobe,
  GitHub Actions CI and GoReleaser-based releases (linux/amd64).
